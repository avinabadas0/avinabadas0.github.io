# Design: Timeline & Skills

## Homepage Restructure
The Hero is now a "Display" element:
- Huge typography for name.
- Minimalist background.
- Primary CTA for "About Me".

## Timeline Design
- **Vertical Orientation**: A dashed or solid line on the left.
- **2025 Focus**: Highlights "Heimdall" with a larger node or distinctive glow.
- **Typography**: Monospace dates (JetBrains Mono) as specified in `design.md`.

## Skills Grid
- **Source**: [DevIcon](https://devicon.dev/)
- **Visuals**: Simple monochrome icons that turn to original color or brighten on hover.
- **Layout**: Flexible wrap grid within a Bento card.

## Projects List
- Minimal cards focused on Title, Tags, and Date.
- Consistent with the primary Bento aesthetic but in a dedicated list format.
